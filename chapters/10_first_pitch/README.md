# Chapter 10: First Pitch Strategy (2015-2025)

## Research Question

**How do pitchers approach the first pitch, and has this evolved over time?**

---

## Key Findings

### 1. First Pitch Fastball Decline

| Year | Fastball % | Breaking % |
|------|------------|------------|
| 2015 | 67.5% | 22.8% |
| 2025 | 60.3% | 30.4% |
| **Change** | **-7.1%** | **+7.6%** |

### 2. Strike Rate Slightly Up

| Year | Strike Rate | In-Zone % |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| 2015 | 49.5% | 52.5% |
| 2025 | 50.5% | 55.1% |

### 3. Statistical Validation

| Metric | Trend | R² | p-value |
|--------|-------|-----|---------|
| Fastball % | -0.77%/year | 0.863 | <0.001 |
| Strike Rate | +0.13%/year | 0.725 | <0.001 |

## Interpretation

Pitchers are becoming more aggressive with breaking balls on the first pitch:
- Less predictable approach
- More strikes despite fewer fastballs
- Part of the broader breaking ball revolution

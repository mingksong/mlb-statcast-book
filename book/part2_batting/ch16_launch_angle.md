# Chapter 16: Launch Angle Transformation

## Key Findings

- **Average launch angle up 6°**: From 11.7° (2015) to 17.8° (2025)
- **Ground balls down 10%**: From 48.1% to 38.1%
- **Fly balls up 3.5%**: From 22.8% to 26.3%
- **The fly ball revolution is real**: Hitters actively elevate the ball

## The Story

This is the chapter that explains the power surge. While exit velocity stayed flat (Chapter 15), launch angle changed dramatically. Hitters learned to lift the ball.

### The Numbers Tell the Story

| Metric | 2015 | 2025 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Avg Launch Angle | 11.7° | 17.8° | +6.1° |
| Ground Ball % | 48.1% | 38.1% | -10.0% |
| Fly Ball % | 22.8% | 26.3% | +3.5% |
| Pop Up % | 7.9% | 17.1% | +9.2% |

## What It Means

1. **The fly ball revolution is real**: Hitters consciously elevate
2. **Trade-off exists**: More fly balls = more pop-ups too
3. **This drove HR surge**: Combined with juiced ball, elevation = power

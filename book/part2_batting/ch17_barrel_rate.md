# Chapter 17: Barrel Rate Analysis

## Key Findings

- **Barrel rate remarkably stable**: ~5% throughout the decade
- **No significant trend**: p=0.878, slope near zero
- **Quality contact unchanged**: Hitters aren't barreling more balls

## The Story

A "barrel" is the holy grail of contact—the perfect combination of exit velocity (98+ mph) and launch angle that produces the best outcomes.

### The Surprise

Despite all the focus on launch angle optimization, barrel rate hasn't changed. About 5% of batted balls are barrels, same as in 2015.

| Year | Barrel Rate |
|------|-------------|
| 2015 | 5.15% |
| 2019 | 5.27% |
| 2025 | 5.29% |

## What It Means

The fly ball revolution (Chapter 16) wasn't about barreling more balls—it was about getting more value from non-barrel contact by elevating instead of hitting grounders.
